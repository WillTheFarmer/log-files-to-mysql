This repository exists because I volunteer at local nonprofit that provides food and clothing for those in need. The Director is familiar with MySQL and wanted to import Apache website logs into MySQL tables. At that meeting I knew little about Apache but lots about MySQL. I thought it would be a couple days to research existing solutions and offered to investigate.

Surprisingly none I found performed any data normalization and were very primitive. The lack of existing relational database open-source solutions led to creation of this solution.

March 2025 was conservatively 1400 hours :hourglass_flowing_sand: of researching existing solutions, database design and SQL/Python development. Python code re-design added another 600 hours. It is much more time then I intended to invest but it did produce my first open-source software and first Python application.
